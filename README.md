# 🚀 My Full Stack Odyssey

Welcome to my digital workshop! This repository is a living chronicle of my journey to becoming a Full Stack Web Developer. It houses every line of code, every "Aha!" moment, and every "Why is this undefined?" struggle I encounter along the way.

## 🗺️ The Roadmap

I'm following a structured path to master the web. Here is the breakdown of the territories I'm exploring:

### 🎨 Frontend (The Look & Feel)

* **HTML5 & CSS3:** Semantic markup, Flexbox, and Grid.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** The engine behind the interactivity.
* **Frontend Frameworks:** Mastering **React.js** (Hooks, State Management, Routing).
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS, Sass, and Responsive Design.

### ⚙️ Backend (The Brains)

* **Node.js & Express:** Building scalable server-side applications.
* **APIs:** Crafting RESTful services and exploring GraphQL.
* **Authentication:** JWT, OAuth, and keeping data secure.

### 💾 Database (The Memory)

* **Relational:** PostgreSQL / MySQL.
* **NoSQL:** MongoDB.
* **ORMs:** Prisma / Mongoose.
